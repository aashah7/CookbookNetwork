<h1>CookbookNetwork</h1>

<p>The Cookbook Network is a virtual recipe book where users will be allowed to share recipes with one another and create their own cookbooks with their favorite recipes. The objective of this application is to have users post recipes, and allow users to search and find recipes they are interested in a quick and simple manner. Each recipe will consist of an image, ingredients, steps, ratings or flags, and short tags. These short tags will describe the type of food that is being made in the recipe, making searching for recipes easier and precise for the user. The Cookbook Network will help users keep track of their favorite recipes by adding it to their cookbook, instead of having to search for it each time. A diverse group of users will be able to enjoy the site, sharing and discovering new recipes from different parts of the world.</p>
